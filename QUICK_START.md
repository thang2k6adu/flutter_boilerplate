## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required

- **Flutter SDK** `>=3.9.2`
  ```bash
  # Check your Flutter version
  flutter --version
  ```

- **Dart SDK** `>=3.9.2` (comes with Flutter)

- **Git**
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

### Recommended

- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development - macOS only)
- **VS Code** with Flutter extension
- **Chrome** (for web development)

### Verify Flutter Installation

```bash
# Run Flutter doctor to check your environment
flutter doctor

# Expected output:
# ✓ Flutter (Channel stable, 3.9.2+)
# ✓ Android toolchain
# ✓ Xcode (for macOS users)
# ✓ Chrome (for web development)
# ✓ VS Code or Android Studio
```

---

## 📥 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd flutter-boilerplate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Flutter packages
flutter pub get
```

**Expected output:**
```
Running "flutter pub get" in flutter-boilerplate...
Resolving dependencies... (2.5s)
Got dependencies!
```

### Step 3: Setup Environment Variables

```bash
# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# Update at minimum:
# - API_BASE_URL (your backend API URL)
# - GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID (from Firebase Console)
```

> **⚠️ Important**: The `.env` file is required for the app to run. See [Configuration](#-configuration) section below for details.

### Step 4: Generate Code

This project uses code generation for Freezed models, JSON serialization, and Riverpod providers.

```bash
# Generate code (one-time)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] Generating build script...
[INFO] Generating build script completed, took 500ms
[INFO] Creating build script snapshot...
[INFO] Creating build script snapshot completed, took 3.2s
[INFO] Building new asset graph...
[INFO] Building new asset graph completed, took 1.5s
[INFO] Running build...
[INFO] Running build completed, took 15.3s
[INFO] Succeeded after 20.5s with 234 outputs
```

> **💡 Tip:** Use watch mode during development to auto-generate code on file changes:
> ```bash
> dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
> ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Firebase Setup (Optional)

If you're using Firebase features:

#### a. Download Configuration Files

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Add Android/iOS apps
4. Download configuration files:
   - **Android**: `google-services.json` → `android/app/`
   - **iOS**: `GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/Runner/`

#### b. Generate Firebase Options

```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI (one-time)
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for your project
flutterfire configure
```

See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for detailed Firebase configuration.

### 2. Environment Variables Setup ⭐

This project uses `.env` files for configuration. This is **REQUIRED** for the app to run.

#### Step 1: Create .env file

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Step 2: Configure your .env

Edit `.env` with your actual values:

```env
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000/api

# Firebase Configuration  
GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-web-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Network Configuration (optional - has defaults)
API_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10000
API_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=3000

# App Configuration (optional)
APP_NAME=Your App Name
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

#### Important Notes:

- **Android Emulator**: Use `http://10.0.2.2:3000/api` (special alias for localhost)
- **iOS Simulator**: Use `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Physical Device**: Use `http://192.168.x.x:3000/api` (your computer's local IP)
- **Google Web Client ID**: Get from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project Settings → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs

#### Step 3: Verify configuration

The app will automatically load `.env` on startup. All API endpoints are managed through:
- `ApiConstants` - Configuration values (from .env)
- `ApiEndpoints` - Endpoint paths

```dart
// Access in code
import 'package:jt291_flutter_mobile/core/constants/constants.dart';

final baseUrl = ApiConstants.baseUrl;        // from .env
final endpoint = ApiEndpoints.authLogin;     // '/auth/login'
```

> **📖 Detailed Guide**: See [ENV_SETUP.md](ENV_SETUP.md) for complete environment configuration guide and [API_ENDPOINTS.md](API_ENDPOINTS.md) for all available endpoints.

flutter pub get

# Delete build folders
rm -rf build/
rm -rf .dart_tool/

# Rebuild
flutter run
```

### Issue: "Firebase configuration not found"

```bash
# Reconfigure Firebase
flutterfire configure

# Make sure you have:
# - android/app/google-services.json
# - ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
# - lib/firebase_options.dart

# For iOS Simulator
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# For Physical Device (use your computer's IP)
API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000/api
```

Make sure your backend server is running and accessible.

### Issue: "Flutter doctor shows issues"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run doctor to see specific issues
flutter doctor -v

# Accept Android licenses
flutter doctor --android-licenses
